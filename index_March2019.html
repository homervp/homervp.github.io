  <h1>About me</h1>

	<h2>Who am I</h2>
	<p>I'm Homer, a computer engineering graduate, Space Engineering postgraduate student, 
	software and game developper by hobby. I'm especially talented at software 
	architecture and design, and most thoroughly enjoy creating configurable, scriptable software and class libraries that allows for diverse execution scenarios without modifying the underlying executables.</p>
	<p>In my free time I play boardgames, videogames, keyboards, and occasionally
	I delve into creative and artistic activities, including 
	sketching, scale modelling and CGI.</p>
	<h2>Studies</h2>
	<p>Academically, I am currently in the Space Engineering MSc program on the 
	University of Surrey, and I've just graduated from the Computer Engineering 
	&amp; Informatics program of the University of Patras polytechnic school (5 
	years, 300ECTS, Integrated MSc in Greece as of 2018, NARIC still lists these 
	programs as BSc(Hons)). During my MSc I will be working on a thesis in astrodynamics, and am interested in pursuing a PhD in space engineering or astrophysics, as I have developped an increasing interest in the physics of the cosmos.</p>
	<p>As far as what exactly I actually and practically do, I'm a software engineer by training and have some contact with systems engineering through my internship at 
	the European Space Agency, all the while I am familiarizing with simulation methods for various physical phenomena. In my free time I mainly develop desktop applications for the Windows in C#, 
	and occasionally video games. In the past, I have been a member of the 
	Microsoft Student Partners for 5 years, serving through the Patras chapter 
	of the Student Guru student society through which MSPs in Greece organize 
	their events. There I presented on average 4 live programming walkthroghs 
	per year. From February 2018 to September 2019 I served as Community Manager 
	for the Student Guru and Microsoft Student Partner community in Patras, and 
	fulfulled Region Manager duties for the UPatras-AUEB-OpenUniversity 
	communities. During this time I reorganized the community, re-establishing 
	our online organization methods. I have been a member of the UPatras Robotics Club for a year during which I mostly helped with minor performance improvements in the maze solver's algorithm. In 2019 I joined the University of Surrey Model UN society, and attended ULMUN at King's College as delegate of the D.R.Congo in the HRC commitee on IDPs, where we reached an agreement signed by all the delegates except one which abstained.
	</p>

	<h2>Work experience</h2>
	<p>As mentioned I have completed a six-month (July 2017 - December 2017) 
	paid traineeship in the European Space Operations Cener (ESOC) of the 
	European Space Agency (ESA) in Frankfurt, where I worked on Systems 
	Engineering. Specifically I was developping a shadow-engineering tool that 
	transfered structured information from the Euclid Ground Segment's database 
	into Enterprise Architect and proceded to generate charts for each element, 
	as well as a couple of design documents to near indistinguishable similarity 
	with the originals.</p>
	<p>After I returned from Germany, I did a three-month paid university 
	internship at the National Healthcare Services ambulance depot near the 
	university. I had already volunteered there for maintenance, support and 
	upgrade of their systems for over a year, when they requested assistance 
	from a professor, who in turn asked if we were interested. After over a year 
	of assisting as volunteers, he suggested to register it as an internship.</p>

	<h2>When am I available?</h2>
	<p>For work, that is. I am graduating in September 2020, but if there's a 
	project that could also work along with my thesis, I might be willing to start work 
	from June. If however I have made other plans, please understand that I am 
	not swayed easily from the course I have plotted, and if I reject an offer 
	it is only so that I can complete these plans; I will probably be more than 
	happy to start working once I've finished with those so please do contact me if you believe I am the right person for the team. I am especially interested in positions that allow me to work toward a PhD in the following areas.</p>

	<h2>What am I interested in?</h2>
	<p>
	I intend to work in aerospace, defense or physics research. I prefer jobs that require decision making and problem solving rather than just implementing what other experts decide, and 
	if the job revolves around programming I also appreciate using stable languages and frameworks, as I prefer creating things with the tools available instead of exploring the tools themselves and 
	spending my time keeping up with frequent changes to them.
	If you're running a research or volunteer project that could benefit from a good engineer on a part time basis, there's always time for something interesting. It always depends on how much is going on at any given time but if not now, quite possibly a couple of months from now I'll be available and willing to put some time and effort into it.
