<p><strong>&nbsp;Intro to x86 Assembly for Windows: concepts and tools</strong></p>
<p>Having MASM32 installed (hopefully without problems), we can proceed to our 
first program. This first one I choose to borrow from Dr.
<a href="http://jeffhuang.com/">Jeff Huang</a>, assistant professor at Brown 
University, the file is hosted at the University of Illinois where he completed 
his Bachelor and Masters. This way at least you have a second source if I don't 
explain something well. The original PDF, with which I myself started x86 
assembly after some Atmel we did in the second semester, can be found right
<a href="https://www-s.acm.illinois.edu/sigwin/old/workshops/winasmtut.pdf">here</a>. 
Let's just drop the code below and see what we can make of it:</p>
<div style="left: 339.6px; top: 474.734px; font-size: 13.3px; font-family: monospace; transform: scaleX(0.999828);">

	.model flat, stdcall <br />
</div>
<div style="left: 339.6px; top: 504.933px; font-size: 13.3px; font-family: monospace; transform: scaleX(0.999828);">

</div>
<div style="left: 339.6px; top: 535.132px; font-size: 13.3px; font-family: monospace; transform: scaleX(0.999828);">

<div style="left: 339.6px; top: 550.232px; font-size: 13.3px; font-family: monospace; transform: scaleX(0.999828);">

<div style="left: 339.6px; top: 565.331px; font-size: 13.3px; font-family: monospace; transform: scaleX(0.999828);">

<div style="left: 339.6px; top: 656.029px; font-size: 13.3px; font-family: monospace; transform: scaleX(0.987359);">

	.code <br />
</div>
<div style="left: 339.6px; top: 701.328px; font-size: 13.3px; font-family: monospace; transform: scaleX(0.999828);">
	start: </div>
<div style="left: 339.6px; top: 716.427px; font-size: 13.3px; font-family: monospace; transform: scaleX(0.987039);">
	invoke StdOut, addr HelloWorld </div>
<div style="left: 339.6px; top: 731.527px; font-size: 13.3px; font-family: monospace; transform: scaleX(0.983203);">
	invoke ExitProcess, 0 </div>
<div style="left: 339.6px; top: 761.726px; font-size: 13.3px; font-family: monospace; transform: scaleX(0.999828);">
	end start </div>
<p>Now we can start. I believe the best idea is to manually write the code line 
by line into MASM32's editor as you read the tutorial for a better 
understanding, at least that's how I function best.</p>
<p>Starting straight off with the first line, the .386 indicates that the 
assembly should be compatible with the .386 Intel processor, this is a directive 
to the assembler mostly, as what commands we use are what determines the 
compatibility (see the introductory assembly "tutorial" where I briefly mention 
key processors and assembly instruction additions).</p>
<p>Next we have the .model directive, followed with <em>flat</em> and <em>
stdcall</em>. The first refers to the way we address memory, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_memory_model">flat model</a> is 
simple and straightforward: access memory linearly. The stdcall part refers to 
how we invoke functions, and this depends largely on language used, and the way 
the compiler takes the arguments for the function. We will see a bit more on 
this when we get into the details of calling functions, which will come soon 
enough. You can explore more options for this line drawing upon the
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ss9fh0d6.aspx">MSDN entry for 
the .model directive</a>, however we will not be touching this, at least not for 
a while. Also note that flat is the model used by windows in general, and thank 
goodness for that because we use a unified pointer format rather than far and 
short that were used in ye old times.</p>
<p>Next we have <em>option casemap :none</em>, as <em>casemap</em> tells us, 
this may have something to do with letter case, and indeed by setting this to
<em>none</em>, we tell MASM that we want this to be a case-sensitive code, no 
labels or names or anything should be mapped to uppercase, lowercase or 
anything. If you work in a team and want to maintain some naming conventions you 
may want another mapping scheme so you can each write names the way you want, be 
it "MyVar", "myVar" or "myvar", and you'll refer to the same variable.</p>
<p>Now we have a few <em>include</em> directives, these are similar to C's <em>
#include</em> directive, you include the content of .inc files into your code 
which contain code, naturally. We include windows.inc, kernel32.inc and 
masm32.inc. masm32.inc contains StdOut among others. The other two refer to the 
host, kernel32.inc will provide us with ExitProcess, while windows.inc has 
Win32Api data and calls. You should feel honored to have the priviledge of 
printf-like StdOut, in the university we used Atmel assembly on ATiny95 boards 
and used GDB (Grub DeBugger) to look at the raw memory to verify results, no 
need to say printing to a terminal is more convenient than line-by-line 
debugging through a terminal.</p>
<p>Next come the <em>includelib</em> directives, targetting the library files 
themselves. They complement the <em>include</em> directives though not directly, 
and they inform the linker that it should link our output to the appropriate 
dll's. Note how, since .inc files contain code, they don't necessarily need a 
coresponding lib file.</p>
<p>The next part is the .data segment, here you initialize your data, so any 
strings you write in C as "whatever the stream is" (including the quotes) should 
be declared here. Other directives we'll see in the future are .data? for 
uninitialized variables, and .const for constants. Accordingly we define 
HelloWorld to include the iconic phrase.</p>
<p><em>start:</em> is rather self-explanatory. It's sort of like main() in C. 
The program just starts here.</p>
<p><em>invoke StdOut, addr HelloWorld</em> is your first function call! This 
call is quite straightforward, we'll see some more details in the short future. 
essentially you call the <em>invoke</em> macro which handles parameter passing, 
we'll see how it's done by hand too later on. Note that we don't use parentheses 
but still separate the parameters with comas.</p>
<p><em>invoke ExitProcess, 0</em> similarly calls a function, which more or less 
stops the program and kills the process. This is necessary for a few reasons, 
most of which are generally anyway handled by the OS, but being tidy helps us 
remain safe and professional. Some reasons could be not executing junk that 
resides in memory after the last command, not executing other code that may 
reside there, not "hanging" and leaving a process open thus maintaining a slot 
in the process table (yes you do have around 65.535 processes in total but if 
you're running the program, say, every second, in an automated fashion, it may 
become an issue), that would make it a <em>zombie process</em>. This roughly 
corresponds to <em>return 0;</em> or <em>return exit_success;</em> in C.</p>
<p><em>end start</em> signifies the end of <em>start</em> as a routine, here due 
to ExitProcess it's not really used but it is used when calling a function.</p>
<p>This concludes this tutorial, there isn't much else to do on your own other 
than trying to add another string and print it.</p>
