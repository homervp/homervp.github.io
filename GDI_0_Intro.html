<p><strong>Win32Api/GDI: Why this?</strong></p>
<p>            Use  of the Windows GDI is discouraged by Microsoft as other libraries and tools  appear and are supported as easier and more agile, but in the same way we learn  assembly in computer engineering departments all over the world, I believe that  knowledge of the GDI provides an insight into the foundations of Windows  graphics. Furthermore, I ended up studying the GDI due to the fact that setting  up most of the other graphics mechanisms turned out to be confusing, too  complicated for what I needed, or not professionally used.</p>
<p> For  example, DirectX needs several pages of setup and twenty times those pages in  tutorials before one can render a single triangle, and getting any leads to  Direct2D is rather hard. Thus for rendering basic 2D graphics I consider  DirectX a bit too in-direct (pun intended) and the code that is actually  describing graphics would be less than a tenth of the entire DirectX code we  would use for these tutorials.</p>
<p> OpenGL is slightly confusing  to set up, actually I wasted multiple hours trying to find the graphics  libraries, and though I found it&rsquo;s code more to the point, this confusion is  discouraging. One may argue that OpenGL does have professional uses, i.e. there  are many applications and games using it that are commercially available, but if  I expand into more commercially applicable libraries, it will be either into  the XNA framework (which I am currently studying) or DirectX, as it seems to  have an uppe hand in the industry as well as the support of Microsoft.</p>
<p> Allegro  is another graphics library which one will clearly come across more than the  others while browsing books on gaming graphics. The problem with Allegro is  that it supports little 3D rendering while it has an all-too-easy set of 2D  functions that will clearly not help introduce you to more serious developing  tools. Furthermore, there are no commercially available games created with it,  and no other libraries linked to it in the way that Direct2D is the successor  of GDI.</p>
<p> Finally,  one goal of learning the GDI is to learn a bit about how Windows work with  device contexts and other such concepts, another is preserving the legacy, and  a last one is building your own graphics library based on the GDI. I only have  a single warning for all this, when projects get a bit too big, chances are it  might become slow, but I am confident that by that time I will have started a  tutorial on the XNA framework (which uses the same code both for PC and XBOX  applications), and you will have enough experience to start using more modern  libraries. Now we can jump to the point and start programming with the GDI!</p>
<p>Before you start though, I should warn you that though you will be learning useful things at a good rate and you will gain some knowledge very few people have any more, it will be a while before you can <em>see</em> that your code can bring results. But be patient, what you can create with the Win32Api and GDI, it is fair to say it's the real world stuff.</p>
