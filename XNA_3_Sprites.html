<p>XNA  Tutorial III: Rendering Sprites</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s  incredibly good about XNA is that it is very direct, it handles all the details  like drawing surfaces but gives you pretty direct control over what&rsquo;s going on.  This time we learn how to render a sprite to the screen – an image that is.</p>
<p> First of all,  to render an image you need one. Not only on your hard drive, but in your game  too. First of all, you will notice in the right hand side, there is the content  browser, or it should anyway. Reference the setup page if it isn&rsquo;t there. Over  there, there are two different folders, if you navigate to your project folder  in an explorer window you will see them there. It is good practice to actually  keep your files in the corresponding folder, though I have not checked if they  are copied there when added through Visual Studio. In any case, you add assets  to your project by dragging and dropping them into the Content folder (should  be the lower one) in the panel on your right. Thus Visual Studio recognizes  them. Note that you still have to do this even if the files are in the right  folder, as by doing this you essentially update the project file to include  these.</p>
<p> After  having the assets in our folder, we must make our game load them. Since we are  talking about images currently, we need to declare a Texture2D object to load  these into. It is possible to load a different image depending on what you want  it to be, however this is mostly useful if you are going to keep the texture  the same for quite a while, as in the case of the easter egg in Survival  Wasteland. It is also possible to create an array of Texture2D objects, mostly  useful for using parallel arrays, as was done with the various items. The  initial loading should be done in the GameLoad() function, which is called upon  starting the game. To load the image into your Texture2D you assign it the  object returned by content.Load&lt;Texture2d&gt;(&ldquo;image_name&rdquo;). Where content  is your ContentManager, preferably the one generated with the code, and Load is  a method which works for various types of objects, as is indicated by the &lt;  and &gt; symbols, which you will also meet in C# lists, after all, XNA works  with C#. You can later load another file into the Texture2D if it needs to  change. Note that image_name, which is the name of the file in any case, goes  in without the extension, so be careful with file conversions, make sure you  exclude the old file from your project if you convert it to another format.</p>
<p> Finally, we  have the matter of printing the textures. Note that .png files and their transparency  are supported, I suggest you use PixelFormer to add transparency, it&rsquo;s a bit  weird to use so you can&rsquo;t actually save the file as png, but rather you export  it. Now, in the Draw() method – and try to keep it there, as was with the GDI –  you use your default SpriteBatch, should be names spritebatch as a matter of  fact, and calle it&rsquo;s function Draw(). Draw() in it&rsquo;s simplest form is defined  as Draw(Texture2D, Vector2, Color), where you place your sprite as an argument,  a vector with it&rsquo;s coordinates (coming back to this in a minute) and a color to  filter the drawing with.</p>
<p> Coordinates  in XNA are stored as Vector2, 2 dimensional vectors. You can edit both axes individually,  or just assign it entirely with it&rsquo;s constructor Vector2(int, int). Keep in  mind that in programming the Y axis starts at the top left corner of the screen  and it&rsquo;s positive is downwards. You will get used to that soon.</p>
<p> The filter,  which you can consider an overlay, is to add effects, essentially a single  color to shift towards. Color.White is the one you want if no effect should  take place. Color.Black will turn it black entirely, while any other color will  turn it pretty much toward it. It is most possible that you will use this to  simulate night, using Color.Blue or Color.CornflowerBlue (the typical blue of  windows). You can also define your own color instance, and as in Survival  Wasteland, increase it&rsquo;s properties to create a transition effect. The  constructor is Color(int Red, int Blue, int Green), and each element is  accessible directly.</p>
<p>  So this is  pretty much what you need to know to do any drawing, if you followed the setup  instructions correctly your sprites should appear back to front, so render them  likewise, as implementing a z-buffer in XNA is harder than in the Win32Api/GDI.</p>
<p> Now you  practically have all you need to play around with, even if it&rsquo;s not very much  alive, you still can implement many projects. Try out making animation by changing  the rendered image at a fast rate, experiment with the speed and frames. In the  next tutorial we will add some sound effects to make our games a bit more  alive, &lsquo;till then, happy coding!</p>
