<h1>Science communication</h1>

<p>I have been semi-regularly engaging in science communication, through talks, 
    panels, manning science stands at pop culture events, and YouTube:</p>

<h2>Stands at events (ESA/EUMETSAT stand)</h2>

<h3>FedCon 2025</h3>

<h3>TimeLash VIII (2024)</h3>

<h3>Speyer Sci-Fi Treffen 2024</h3>

<h2>Talks and panels</h2>

<h3>Asteroid fields and nebulae in science and fiction - Timelash VIII (2024)</h3>


<h3>ESA/EUMETSAT Q&A panel @ FedCon 2025</h3>

<h3>ESA/EUMETSAT Q&A panel @ TimeLash VIII (2024)</h3>

<h2>YouTube</h2>

I run the YouTube channel "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH_Va0y1QdZuNJDeOfkBWaw">Homer's Spacetime Odyssey</a>", 
where I try to connect concepts from pop culture to their scientific counterparts, 
and explore how real science can drive narratives with more creativity, flexibility and immersion.

Next video: end of July (Light and sight beyond the visible spectrum)

<h2>Event volunteer</h2>
<h3>ESA Open Day 2025</h3>
