	      <h2>About me:</h2>
			<p>Right now I'm an undergraduate trainee at ESA/ESOC in Darmstadt, 
			Germany, working on Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). I'm entering my fifth year of the five-year 
			Diploma of Engineering 
			degree in Coputer Engineering and Informatics at the polytechnic 
			school of the University of Patras, Greece, a 5 year, 300 ECTS 
			program with integrated Masters equivalence. I'm an active member of 
			the Microsoft Student Partners since my first year in the university, 
			member of UPatras Robotics Club and Student 
			Guru Patras communities, writing code and participating in 
			presentations and events. In my free time I'm developing video 
			games, right now I'm in the process of finalizing Flotilla WWII 
			which passed Steam Greenlight and will be released on Steam, while 
			I'm working on wrapping XNA into an engine of my own, which will be 
			used for faster development of a 3D sequel to Flotilla WWII and hopefully many other 
			projects to come!</p>
			<p>My strong points are system design and architecture and, of 
			course, programming efficiently! However I am also very interested 
			in many other topics and have gathered some skills outside the field 
			of pure programming, for example I am fascinated by game theory and 
			have a firm understanding of its basic principles and most common 
			methods. I am also very interested in 
			branching into other fields, more notable examples being 
			computational physics and simulation, and other more distant topics 
			like experimental physics or classical engineering.</p>
			<p>I am looking for new opportunities all the time, of course 
			tasks already undertaken have priority, but I am very interested in 
			additional internships during the remainder of my studies as well as 
			research and collaboration opportunities. I will continue to obtain 
			a Masters degree upon graduation, and intend to also obtain a PhD 
			(but that's still a bit distant!).</p>

<h2 class="auto-style1"><strong>Flotilla WWII  </strong>  </h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/flotilla-wwii">Flotilla WWII</a> is a 
WWII naval TBS game, featuring basic AI, A* pathfinding, random map generation 
of island maps of varying sizes, and a total of 17 buildable units. It was 
submitted to
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=748309980">Steam 
Greenlight</a> on September 2016 and on June 2017 it was greenlit by Valve 
employees before the termination of the Greenlight service. It has undergone 
extensive polishing and the latest update is yet to be released (more intuitive 
pathfinding, water animation and animated smoke). It will be published on Steam 
as soon as the necessary paperwork is completed and the final touches added.<br />

          <h3>            Another project has been running in XNA under the name <a href="SurvivalWasteland.html">Survival Wasteland</a>, utilizing more complex game mechanics and with code far easier to modify. Some of the mechanics include an inventory system, crafting, interacting with environment and man-made objects, use of multiple gameplay areas and more to come. The project intends to create a game where everything the player does can theorhetically be done in a near identical way in real life. The project's facebook page, IndieDataBase and ModDataBase page is right below:<br />

  Survival Wasteland was submitted for the Greek finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2014 and development continued until July 2015.
  <br />
  Currently the game is being ported to UE4 while being upgraded to 3D graphics, part of the code written during the port to UE4 can be found in the UE4 tutorials in the tutorials section of my site.<br />
			Development has been delayed in favor or games with a smaller, 
			controllable scope which can be completed in more realistic times, 
			but the project has not been halted.<br />

C# is my language of choice, and I have experimented with a number of libraries, including the CodeDOM compiler and the voice synthesizer and speech recognition libraries. Most of my applications are built in Windows Forms and usually .NET 4.0, making them backwards compatible with legacy systems.<br />

          <h3>UDK: My studies in UDK and the UnrealScript language led to the creation of a utility to assist in searching through UnrealScript code, by scanning the UDK directory and constructing the full hierarchy of the classes, as well as allowing searching and previewing classes. The project was released under the name UnrealScriptHelper on <a href="http://download.cnet.com/UnrealScript-Hierarachy-Explorer/3000-2352_4-76321252.html">CNET</a>.</h3>
        <h3>Tutorials: To gain a better understanding of subjects and knowledge I use, I am writing tutorials for other programmers to use, as much of their content is hard to find, and is often inexistent in the form of a tutorial. Currently I have uploaded tutorials on C and the Win32Api, while I add to these I will write tutorials for C++, the GDI, and later for the XNA framework. These can be found in the <a href="TutorialCentral.html">Tutorial Section</a>.</h3></div>
