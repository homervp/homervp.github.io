	<div class="category" id="SpacEx">
	  <h1 >Space exploration</h1>
	  	<h2>Scott Manley</h2>
		<p>The go-to YouTuber for keeping up with space exploration updates, but 
		also learning about space technology, space history and occasionally 
		astrophysics. His videos typically feature him on camera with relevant 
		images or videos taking over when appropriate, and extensive use of Kerbal 
		Space Program to demonstrate principles. Scott holds degrees in astrophysics 
		and is currently working for Apple as a software engineer.</p>

		</div>
		
	  	<h2>Everyday Astronaut</h2>
		<p>A less dense but ever enthusiastic approach to the subject of space, a 
		former astronaut talks in depth about various aspects of space exploration. 
		Some of the perks of his connections include on-site visits and 
		demonstrations, however the videos are often longer (some reaching an hour), 
		the upload schedule can be irregular and relatively sparse, and in a way 
		rather characteristic of American YouTubers, not that dense. Also often 
		uploads an entire stream of a launch (as in, a three hour stream).</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="category" id="VFX_CG_film">
	  <h1 >VFX, CG and Cinemato	graphy</h1>
	  	<h2>Corridor Crew</h2>
		<p>Members of professional VFX studio Corridor Digital, known for their own 
		short comedic VFX films on the eponymous channel, do breakdowns of film and 
		television scenes analyzing the VFX and stunts in their "VFX artists react" 
		and "Stuntmen react" series. A must for anyone interested in effects and 
		cinematography, they provide unparalleled insight into how the scenes were 
		made, but also point out remarkable achievements, techniques and also 
		mistakes.</p>
	  	<h2>Captain Disilusion</h2>
		<p>This quirky persona takes it upon himself to slap some sense into the 
		world, debunking and recreating videos that have often gone viral but are 
		made with visual effects.</p>
	  	<h2>Indy Mogul</h2>
		<p>A channel dedicated to independent and amateur videographers, covering 
		everything from camera settings, setting up the room and lighting, all the 
		way to visual effects and props. I first watched their Backyard FX series, 
		but have since made use of their advice in other videos too.</p>
		<h2>Ian Huber - Lazy Tutorials</h2>
		<p>A CG artist with a talent for making (extremely) short, clear and useful tutorials primarily on creating 3D scenes very easily, efficiently and cleanly.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="category" id="Hist_Arch">
	  <h1 >History and archaeology</h1>
	  	<h2>Extra History</h2>
		<p>The veterans of Extra Credits decided they could also teach history, and 
		they were right. The very familiar and characteristic art style gives good 
		visual cues to bind to very well presented bits history, typically in 
		serials of 3-7 episodes covering a war, campaign or biography, but also 
		shorter episodes on significant events and incidents, like the Wall Street 
		crash or Irish Potato Famine. Although the original Extra Credits channel 
		has seen better days (as of early 2021), Extra History maintains its quality 
		and goes a step further with the "Lies" episodes, where they correct errors 
		they made during the series.</p>
		
	  	<h2>The History Guy</h2>
		<p>With his iconic bowtie and the slogan "because history deserves to be 
		remembered", the history guy regularly features videos 10-15 minutes long on 
		noteworthy isolated events which will likely have passed under your radar 
		but are important for anyone studying their period in depth. Topics range 
		from the history of a ship, a significant industrial accident, a battle and 
		even a tradition or cultural symbol (see the great moustache strike of 
		Paris). Presentation is vivid with good imagery to assist, and the topics 
		are always surprisingly interesting.</p>
		
	  	<h2>Armchair Historian</h2>
		<p>Significant events in history narated with excellent illustrations. This 
		is a great channel if you have a bit more time (videos usually range from 15 
		to 40 minutes) and want to learn not just more about events you have heard 
		of a dozen times, but also learn about other significant events that are 
		glossed over in the highschool history textbooks.</p>
		
	  	<h2>Mark Felton Productions</h2>
		<p>Though more serious in narration and visual aids, Mark Felton delivers 
		detailed and well researched videos into some of the more obscure events, 
		mostly in WWII. The videos have a lot of information and make extensive use 
		of footage, maps and images. If you are looking for coverage of events no 
		one else has even mentioned, this is a good place to be.</p>
	  	
	  	<h2>Lindybeige</h2>
		<p>Archaeologist by training, Nicholas Lloyd delivers extensive, dense and 
		detailed invormation on historical events, warfare, what life was like and 
		so on. Aside from being a walking history book, Nicholas is also a swing and 
		lindy hop instructor, war reenactor, chartered camera man and a few other 
		things.</p>
		
		<h2>Kings and Generals</h2>
		<p>Long in-depth dives into leaders or campaigns, with high quality animated maps and visual aids. The presentation and research is top quality</p>
		
		<h2>Johnny Johnson</h2>
		<p>Reviews scenes from historic (mostly WWII and later) war movies commenting on the vehicles and equipment used when filming and the relative authenticity of the equipment and depiction.</p>
		
		<h2>SandRhoman History</h2>
		<p>Detailed analyses of how warfare was carried out, technologies and historical events in the roman, medieval and gunpowder eras.</p>
		<h2>G.I. History Handbook</h2>
		<p>Though the naration could be a bit more vivid, the videos detail 
		military doctrine and tactics using the actual field manuals of the 
		period and meoirs of the soldiers who employed them, creating an 
		accurate and representative picture of how combat was actually 
		conducted. Visual aids and diagrams accompany the narration to draw a 
		clear picture.</p>
		<h2>Drachinifel</h2>
		<p>In-depth naval history, covering events, engineering and trends primarily in the two world wars, but also venturing into ironclads and the age of sail. For such an underapreciated subject, 
		Drachinfel's videos are a treasure trove of information.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="category" id="Misc">
	  <h1 >Miscelaneous skills and trivia</h1>
	  	<h2>The Modern Rogue</h2>
		<p>Jason Murphy and Brian Brushwood explore various topics, usually learning 
		the basics through research or with the help of an expert guest, and try 
		their own hand at it. The episodes generally fall under three categories: 
		Learning a new pracical skill, going through a list of interesting facts, 
		and learning about a topic, such as etiquete at social events or everything 
		there is to know about whiskey collections. Some of the more interesting (to 
		me) episodes include stenography and basic cryptography (as well as a 
		treasure hunt using the techniques they learned) and amateur radio and SSTV. 
		Their upload schedule is fairly regular (once or twice a week) and being 
		professional showmen, they always provide some good humor and entertainment.</p>
		
		<h2>Grand Illusions</h2>
		<p>A channel and novelty toy shop ran by two retired BBC producers and presented by Tim Rowett, who has been collecting toys for over 30 years, the videos on their YouTube channel pick a theme and Tim 
		starts showing items from his collection and the shop that put a spin on the theme, offering some thoughts as well as insight into the inner workings of some of these items. The videos are 
		characteristically sere with Tim's calming voice and no background music to distract; personally I find them a lot more interesting than ASMR.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="category" id="Chem">
	  <h1 >Chemistry</h1>
	  	<h2>Cody's Lab</h2>
		<p>Typically Cody starts with some object and declares that he will 
		chemically extract a specific element from it. Among others, he recently 
		extracted a considerable quantity of pure potassium from bananas, and he has 
		extracted gold from electronics, uranium from asphalt (YouTube was not too 
		happy about that) and others. This definitely falls under the "do not do 
		this at home", as something like producing a cloud of cyanide is not unusual 
		for this show. His upload schedule is not particularly regular and sometimes 
		uploads something off-topic.</p>
	  	<h2>Nile Red</h2>
		<p>I am not as closely acquainted with Nile Red, but again we have a skilled 
		chemist using his skills to synthesize or isolate complex substances.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="category" id="Literature">
	  <h1 >Literature</h1>
	  	<h2>Extra Sci-Fi</h2>
		<p>Another spin-off of Extra Credits, Extra Sci-Fi goes through some of the 
		classics of science fiction, often works you wouldn't expect. They took a 
		chronological approach, with Mary Schelley's Frankenstein being the first 
		episode, and have covered iconic figures like H.P Lovecraft, Isaac Asimov, 
		Arthur C. Clark and many others. If you are not into sci-fi you may think 
		this is not for you, but I urge you to watch the episodes on Stand on 
		Zanzibar, which was written some 60 years ago but is spookily close to 
		today's world, and The Belonging Kind, where Gibson touches a very modern 
		subject <em>very</em> effectively.</p>
	  	<h2>Thug Notes</h2>
		<p>This is probably the most unique channel in here. A straight-up gangsta 
		gives a quick summary of a classic literary work, and proceeds to give a 
		concise analysis, explaining the main theme and the writer's approach to it, 
		as well as symbolisms in the book. All the while speaking the kind of 
		language you would expect to hear in the neighbourhood Lil'Jon grew up in (I 
		assume, I don't know where he grew up). Non-native English speakers be 
		warned, you'll want to turn on the closed captions on this one (c button by 
		default). The rest of you, prepare for a hilarious educational journey.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="category" id="Sci_Eng_Tech">
	  <h1 >General Science, Engineering and Technology</h1>
	  	<h2>SciShow</h2>
		<p>Another PBS production, SciShow covers all sorts of topics of scientific 
		interest, from biology to quantum mechanics to AI, with lively presentation 
		and quality production values. Always interesting, often a good starting 
		point for a long dive into a subject.</p>
	  	<h2>It's OK To Be Smart</h2>
		<p>Covering a variety of topics in the natural sciences, this channel 
		delivers lively presentation with useful visual aids and a variety of 
		interesting topics, often related to things we experience every day.</p>
	  	<h2>MinutePhysics</h2>
		<p>Usually very short videos covering a specific phenomenon, though sometimes 
		they do have to cross the ten-minute mark. Explanations are pretty concise 
		and simple to understand, but still provides enough interesting information 
		to keep people in the sciences just as engaged.</p>
		<h2>2MinutePapers</h2>
		<p>Short videos (typically 2-5 minutes) presenting a scientific publication in lay man's terms and providing context or its significance. </p>
	
	  	<h2>SmarterEveryDay</h2>
		<p>Destin is very enthusiastic about the world around him and the phenomena 
		in it. A former NASA engineer, he can tackle all sorts of subjects, but more 
		importantly is excellent at spotting very interesting facts just about 
		anywhere. Just watch the couple of videos he has made about the design of 
		machinery and buildings in farms and you will be surprised how interesting 
		that can be. Some more conventionally interesting topics he has covered is 
		sonar, life on a nuclear submarine, the Mars rover and the YouTube 
		algorithms.</p>
		
	  	<h2>Quanta Magazine</h2>
		<p>A good place to get an information dump on a specific topic, or even a 
		yearly update on everything new that happenned the last year in a field. It 
		covers all areas of science and technology.</p>
		
	  	<h2>Technology Connections</h2>
		<p>A very interesting channel, as unlike most of my recommendations this one 
		is very down to earth: while others are thrilled by the unique and the 
		exotic, the cosmic and the cutting edge, Technology Connections is very well 
		aware of the ingenuity that goes into everyday things. Thougt your [insert 
		random household appliance] was boring? This channel can certainly tell you 
		something interesting about how (and even why) it works.</p>
		
		<h2>The Royal Insttution</h2>
		<p>Host hour-long (give or take fifteen minutes) lectures by experts on 
		their field. The lectures are long enough that they can cover a number of 
		interesting topics in some depth. The Royal Institution is one of the more 
		prestigious scientific organizations worldwide, and as such has veritable 
		celebrities delivering the lectures.</p>
		
	  	<h2>Real Engineering</h2>
		<p>Episodes around 15-20 minutes centered on the engineering challenges and 
		leaps that make certain vehicles, infrastructure and projects stand out and 
		shine. A lot of innovative ideas and engineering principles are analyzed and 
		explained with very good visuals and presentation.</p>
		
	  	<h2>Curious Droid</h2>
		<p>This channel has a preference toward unique military vehicles and spaec 
		exploration but doesn't hesitate to deliver solid content in physics and 
		other science and engineering topics. Presented by Uncle Fester's slightly 
		more normal doppelganger with the enthusiasm that Fester would show for a 
		crate of TNT, the videos are very enjoyable and very informative.</p>
		
	  	<h2>Kyle Hill</h2>
		<p>A rather lightweight channel that takes a dive sometimes into real world 
		facts, sometimes into a scientific analysis of science fiction and fantasy 
		hypotheticals, Kyle Hill keeps your attention with visuals and light humour 
		while making the workings of things around us very plain to understand.</p>
		
	  	<h2>Kurtzgesagt</h2>
		<p>A channel that stands out for its characteristic rich animation but 
		delivers quite seriously in topics ranging from astrophysics to AI to 
		viruses and biology, Kurtzgesagt has earned a very good reputation with good 
		reason. As the name suggests ("shortly said" or "in a nutshell" in German), 
		the videos tend to be short (around 7 minutes) and give a pretty solid 
		introduction to their varying topics.</p>
		
		<h2>It's okay to be smart</h2>
		<p>By one of the presenters of PBS SciShow, It's okay to be smart explores various topics with a brief but deep dive into the science behind them, ranging from biology to engineering and astrophysics.</p>
		
		<h2>US Auto Industry</h2>
		<p>Old (from 1930s even) videos explaining the mechanics of cars, such as gearboxes, differential drive etc.</p>
		
		<h2>Artifexian</h2>
		<p>Though a channel dedicated to worldbuilding (the creation of fictional worlds and settings for literature, 
		film and interactive media), unlike other channels that focus on plot and planning, this one dives
		 deep into the science behind various phenomena, focusing on creating organic and believable worlds. Topics cover anything among galaxies, star formation, planet formation, plate tectonics, and other
		 topics in geology, such as mountain and river formation and mineral deposits, and even climate and atmosphere. The subjects are given an impressively scientific approach, with plenty of terminology, statistics
		 and even formulas for calculating things such as planet gravity, density, atmosphere density at different altitudes, river depths and widths based on rainfall, planet temperatures based on distance from star, etc.
		 Learning these topics as tools to create new worlds has been a blast!</p>
		 
		 <h2>Tom Scott</h2>
		<p>A software engineer and linguist, Tom Scott travels to interesting places to talk about strange structures, devices and phenomena, and the science behind them.</p>
		
		<h2>Steve Mould</h2>
		<p>Steve Mould talks about a whole host of topics ranging from technology to biomechanics and how our brain processes the world around us. It is hard to put a finger on what exactly he does, 
		but it's always something interesting.</p>


	</div>
	
	<div class="category" id="Electr">
	  <h1 >Electronics</h1>
	  	<h2>Electroboom</h2>
		<p>Mehdi is an electrical engineer that demonstrates all things electric and 
		gets shocked in the process. The first couple of times you may think that he 
		is incompetent, but you will soon realize how good he must be to have been 
		shocked so many times and still be alive. Aside from enjoying Mehdi getting 
		shocked at least twice per video, you will also learn a lot about 
		electricity and circuits. He also has great humour, and his jokes, whether 
		verbal or visual, deliver every time.</p>
		<h2>Great Scott</h2>
		<p>A large variety of slightly more advanced electronics projects with a detailed explanation of the workings and creation process. 
		These projects are complete and not just a small experiment, so the end 
		product is quite presentable.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="category" id="Math_Crypto_CS">
	  <h1 >Mathematics, Cryptography and Computer Science</h1>
	  	<h2>Computerphile</h2>
		<p>Hosted by the University of Nottingham, academics and professionals talk 
		about various topics and algorithms explaining them with simplicity and 
		precision. Very approachable and fairly dense in content, as it typically 
		revolves around the solutions people found to problems, this channel never 
		fails to stimulate the mind. Topics include cryptography, pathfinding, 
		sorting, networking, graphics and others drawn from computer science.</p>
	  	<h2>Numberphile</h2>
		<p>A sister channel to Computerphile, Numberphile is also hosted by th 
		University of Nottingham. Again academics and professionals join to put into 
		layman's terms mathematical puzzles and problems, and explain the surprising 
		answers that often occur. It is usually my position that raw mahematics 
		stripped of its application is pointless, but Numberphile at least proves 
		that it can still be very interesting.</p>
	  	<h2>Ben Eater</h2>
		<p>Ever considered making your own computer from scratch? This guy pretty 
		much did it, enough said. Only it's not enough said, because he explains the 
		how and why and guides you through the process with solid explanation.</p>
	  	<h2>Standup Maths</h2>
		<p>A very enthusiastic journey into mathematical problems and oddities, this 
		channel could be compared to Numberphile in terms of depth and engagement, 
		but has a distinct approach, less of a tutorial session and more of a guided 
		tour. Not unlike Numberphile, Standup Maths will bring to your attention 
		noumerous mathematical oddities and interesting properties.</p>
	  	<h2>3Blue1Brown</h2>
		<p>One of the more advanced mathematics channels, 3Blue1Brown explains in 
		depth some advanced topics in linear algebra, signal processing and other 
		fields, with very good visuals and explanations. I have used this channel to 
		study for some of the more advanced modules of my CE integrated masters.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="category" id="Comp_user">
	  <h1 >Computers (non-scientific)</h1>
	  	<h2>Linus Tech Tips</h2>
		<p>Everyone who wants to build their own computer or make a very educated 
		choice when buying must watch Linus Tech Tips. Although most of the content 
		is around a specific part or build, LTT has made a number of videos 
		explaining more obscure specs like cache latency, RAM types and the numbers 
		described, overclocking and just about any value you can find printed on a 
		product's description. Throughout the other videos some in-depth tips and 
		explanations are also given, so it is worth watching if you want to know the 
		ins and outs of computer.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="category" id="Think">
	  <h1 >Ways of thinking, philosophy and knowledge</h1>
	  	<h2>VSausce</h2>
		<p>Prepare for a cerebral journey like no other. Typically exploring a 
		common theme, VSauce starts from one topic and spins a wild ride along 
		seemingly unrelated topics connected each time by a common point, arriving 
		to one greater conclusion that connects everything together. Superb research 
		and compelling presentation make VSauce a channel whose videos keep 100% of 
		your attention and which you can watch over and over, as there is so much 
		knowledge crammed into such an unpredictable path that it is impossible to 
		capture everything in one sitting. This is definitely one of the channels 
		that will broaden your mental horizons. Also of particular interest is the 
		Mindfield series, which takes a more focused and lengthy dive into various 
		deep concepts that characterize humanity, often recreating experiments and 
		interviewing the subjects to give a better understanding.</p>
	  	<h2>Veritasium</h2>
		<p>Like VSauce I cannot quite put Veritasium quite into the science 
		channels, as here too you will get this distinct feeling of learning a lot 
		of different interesting stuff in a wide variety of topics, that slowly 
		change your perception of the world. Veritasium is presented by a 
		professional TV host and enjoys this extra layer of professionalism, without 
		the constraints of television.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="category" id="Maker">
	  <h1 >People making stuff</h1>
	  	<h2>How To Make Everything</h2>
		<p>Andy originally started out with the question "how is [insert item] 
		made?", following the whole process from the planting/harvesting/collection 
		of raw materials to the end product, and making one himself with materials 
		he harvested himself. That's how you end up with a $1500 sandwitch. But the 
		channel really found its calling with "the reset", from which point onward 
		Andy and his assistant began literally from scratch, harvesting materials 
		with their bare hands, and only use tools they have already made, using 
		tools they have already made, using tools they have [....] made literally 
		from scratch. As such they have gone through flintknapping and stone tools, 
		to copper, to bronze and currently to iron tools, forging and casting them 
		themselves (with a first-time tutorial from an expert). They often do an 
		episode on food but I suspect it is so they can keep some regularity while 
		they are working hard to make the next step toward the industrial 
		revolution. This is a must-watch for history enthusiasts, as they can 
		observe the HTME crew go through the original processes used to create the 
		items we see in museums.</p>
	  	<h2>Stuff Made Here</h2>
		<p>A newcommer to the creative family on YouTube, Stuff Made Here is working 
		on rather ambitious projects with fairly good results. Some current examples 
		include a bullet-powered baseball bat that hits balls with lethal force, a 
		machine to press steel toes for crocs, and not one but two robots that can 
		give someone a haircut, which kind of work.</p>
	  	<h2>Mark Rober</h2>
		<p>Mark makes interesting machines of very good quality and performance, and 
		uploads about once per month. Though for the most part very worthwhile, with 
		devices like dartboards and basketball hoops that move into the way of your 
		projectile so you can get a perfect hit, oversized nerf guns and water guns 
		and more, there are the occasional somewhat disappointing (for me) uploads, 
		where he re-iterates on an existing project or does something that feels 
		very miscellaneous even for his miscellaneous builds (squirrel obstacle 
		course? It was fun but it wasn't the technological marvel I was hoping for 
		after a month of waiting).</p>

	  	<h2>Extra credits</h2>
	  	<p>Literally hundreds (I estimate 250+) videos on systems in video games, tropes, themes, mechanics, keeping player attention, but also some practical issues like
	  	 ethics and legal matters. Extra Credits is the grand daddy of video game design channels. The content has become rather sparse from 2020 onward, possibly due to the
	  	 departure of the original writer James, but it is absolutely worth going back and through the 8 or so seasons where the original host, Dan, was narating, and even into the seasons
	  	 with the new narator, Matt. To be clear, there has been some backlash to the recent cast changes, but they came after specific videos came out, which contradicted older ones. Nevertheless,
	  	 they still usually produce valuable content, even if less dense.</p>
	  	<p>I have watched every single Extra Credits video to date, and recommend you watch the videos on skinner boxes, MMO economies, worldbuilding and quest design II (also I, but II blew my mind)</p>

	  	<h2>Adam Millard - The Architect of Games</h2>
	  	<p> Ambitious though this channel's name may be, the videos uploaded go in depth into various mechanics, themes or the design of a specific game, providing valuable insight and breakdowns.</p>
	  	
	  	<h2>Game Maker's Toolkit (GMTK)</h2>
	  	<p>Monthly breakdowns of systems and design decisions, usually often a specific game as a central example, analyzing why and how they work.</p>
	  	
	  	<h2>GDC (Game Developers Conference)</h2>
	  	<p>If you're talking video game design, one must assume that the Game Developer Conference will have some great stuff, right? Well, often. Though I have found some great talks, there are also many one-hit wonders doing
	  	 "post-mortems" (a term I heartily hate, loath, detest and so on) where they just talk about their game. But there are also many industry titans talking about the development and evolution of systems of actually
	  	 very significant games.</p>
	  	 
	  	<h2>ArsTechnica - War Stories</h2>
	  	<p>Refering specifically to the series War Stories rather than the entire channel. War Stories is a series of interviews with the men behind legendary titles, talking about the feature that made their
	  	 game so iconic and successful, and the challenges they faced. Some examples are how the Crash Bandicoot hacked the Playstation to multiply its rendering performance, how Prince of Persia defeated Apple II's
	  	 memory limiations, and the difficulties in implementing Thief's stealth or Command &Aacute; Conquer's pathfinding.</p>	 
	  	  	 
	  	<h2>AI and Games</h2>
	  	<p>AI and Games usually talks about the tricks and techniques used in the artificial intelligence of a specific game each time, but sometimes also about the history and evolution of said techniques, and 
	  	occasionally about the game design itself.</p>	  	 
	  	
	  	<h2>Sebastian Lague</h2>
	  	<p>Sebastian Lague's channel is a very special one, in that his videos document his journey implementing a specific feature. Essentially he develops a mini-game around a concept like generating planets, 
	  	recreating atmospheric effects, simulating a small ecosystem or using real-world heightmap data for the environment. What's more, he extensively uses shaders for everything, to the point where there is 
	  	essentially no point using an engine. On top of that he plainly shows the relevant snippets of code so all the knowledge is transferable to your own projects</p>
