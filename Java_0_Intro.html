<p>Introduction to Java</p>
<p>Java is a  cross-platform language created by James Gosling in Sun Microsystems in the  early 90&rsquo;s and first published in 1995 to meet great success with the public.  Sun has since been purchased by Oracle, which continues evolving Java, having  recently released Java 8.</p>
<p> Java does not compile  directly to an executable, but rather to bytecode which is executed through the  Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that as long as there is a JVM release  for the specific system in use, there is no need to recompile or port a project  to that system, but the same compilation can be ran directly on the system.</p>
<p> Java is generally said  to be a sibling to C++, however it is apparent and well established that it  takes a different approach and has equal similarities with other languages.  Java features fewer low level commands, while it&rsquo;s code is managed, meaning  that in contrast to C and C++, and similarly to C#, it does not give the user  access to memory management, not allowing pointers, memory allocation and other  low level features, but rather handles memory automatically. Though this may  occasionally make implementing something you would normally do with pointers  rather hard, it does make it harder to have rogue pointers which may change  wrong data, and theoretically makes Java applications safer towards the  machine.</p>
<p> Due to some  peculiarities, others owing to the aforementioned functionality and others not,  it is advisable in my opinion to have ease with another language prior to  learning Java, ideally C#, Java does give quick results so assuming you are  motivated by these you should be able to learn Java at a reasonable pace.</p>
<p> Also due to a  particular peculiarity, I will first have to show you how to output data and  perform calculations, as input has an interesting safety requirement that could  be characterized as more &ldquo;advanced&rdquo;.<br />
Finally I must state  that I will not go into detail about the syntax and some other things that I  have already covered in the C tutorials, this will make the Java tutorials  immense, after all, as I said, it is highly advised that you have some previous  programming experience.</p>
<p> Keeping all this in  mind, proceed to tutorial I where I will show you how to make the Java Hello  World.</p>
