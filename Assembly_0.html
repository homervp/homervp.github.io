<p><strong>&nbsp;Intro to x86 Assembly for Windows: concepts and tools</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to a series of tutorials on x86 assembly for Windows systems. The 
concepts and teachings of these tutorials are applicable to all operating 
systems that run on Intel or AMD processors, whether x86 (32 bit) or x64 
(64bit). In this tutorial we will look at assembly in general from a far scope, 
and cover a few historical issues, as well as explain why we use some 
Windows-only functionality and why that does not differ from writing on another 
system.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1: The tools.</strong></p>
<p>Most of you probably want to get down and dirty with some code, that much we 
do in the next tutorial, but for now we can set up our tool of choice:
<a href="http://www.masm32.com/">MASM32</a>. The 32 part refers to the 32bit 
systems targetted by this assembler, and MASM stands for Macro ASeMbler, and it 
traces its routes back to the Microsoft Macro Assembler. You can download the 
installer from the <a href="http://www.masm32.com/download.htm">downloads page</a> 
and mostly any info you need for the installation
<a href="http://www.masm32.com/install.htm">here</a>. Actually there is also a 
lot of info in that last link telling you that this software operates as 
autonomously as possible.</p>
<p>An <em>important</em> point to keep is that you have to tell MASM32 where 
you're working. Create a new file with the .asm extention (still editable in 
notepad or whatever, it's still an ASCII file), open it up, and then go 
File-&gt;Set Current Directory (Shift + F12). Otherwise you'll get complaints that 
the file wasn't found. To keep things clean, I keep my code in a folder named 
"Assembly" in the C or D drive, the essense is that it is easily accessible so I 
don't have to navigate too much.</p>
<p><em><strong>Attention! </strong></em>When editing a sample from within 
MASM32, or anything for that matter, always save a copy (File -&gt; Save As)
<strong>BEFORE</strong> saving anything and work on that. This is because 1) you
<em>will</em> overwrite the file when saving, and 2) Undo works only up to the 
last save, i.e. if you don't remember what was there before, you'll be looking 
real hard to find it elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2: Intro.</strong></p>
<p>The Microsoft Macro Assembler was used in conjunction with Microsoft Visual 
C++ 2.0 (I have an already really old book on VCpp 5.0 so you get the picture of 
antiquity) to create the original Grand Theft Auto. This small detour is just an 
indicator of how realistic it can be to write assembly. Of course today's insane 
specs lead programmers to just write in sloppy languages with immense overhead, 
but there is always a demand for highly skilled, very well paid assembly 
programmers in the most demanding fields out there, including the gaming 
industry, operating systems developers (can't avoid assembly there), and 
high-performance applications. Assembly may well be used in software drivers or 
firmware, so expect to see them in Google's datacenters, as they use their own 
file system for their immense data, as well as in the Wacom pen tablets, which 
calculate the pressure of your pen and the exact coordinates where you're 
drawing.</p>
<p>Assembly is sought after because it is as fast as possible, given that the 
assembler translates what you write directly into machine code, and there are no 
language-added segments, calls etc inserted so as to cover all possible uses. In 
short, you sacrifice more general, faster to use methods, for very specific 
commands that will be executed without question, doing only what you say and 
nothing more. This is what makes assembly programming fast, and the programms 
created very small.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3: Concept.</strong></p>
<p>I was about to name this part "Intuition", but that's something that comes 
with experience. As mentioned in Part 2, your commands are translated directly 
into machine commands. It's not that you can't use existing functions etc, you 
most definitely can. But you won't get generalizations and "shortcuts", which 
often add a few more commands, which when piled up in a nested loop can multiply 
the total commands executed. So what do you work with?</p>
<p>The most obvious things you work with are additions, subtractions, 
multiplications, divisions. Each one takes two things and stores the result in a 
third place. Then you've got data loading and storing methods. This refers to 
storing data into memory, as your commands will work with CPU registers, which 
are limited. There are other commands that complement all these aforementioned 
commands, such as XOR for example, or block-transfer commands for copying large 
amounts of memory.</p>
<p>The next level of things you'll need are branching statements, here
<span class="auto-style1">goto</span> rules. You'll place tags which mark the 
important points in your code, routine entries, where a loop starts and so on. 
Then you get branch and jump commands, which allow you to go to another part of 
code based on the result of an operation. This just means that to execute an 
if() statement, you'll execute the operation within, and then tell the computer 
to go to an appropriate place if the result is the one specified. We'll get 
there soon, don't worry too much. The main thought to keep is that a loop is 
just an if() with a goto statement, as long as the condition is true, goto the 
start of the loop.</p>
<p>Finally, we'll see how to use functions, i.e. commands created by others or 
even ourselves. We'll be loading libraries from the very first tutorial so we 
can print our results to the terminal. Later we'll be creatng windows through 
assembly code too, and this is the only limitation put by this tutorial 
essentially, my choice of libraries. Locate the right libraries on any other 
system, and it'll work just fine.</p>
<p><strong>Part 4: Historics.</strong></p>
<p>It is usefull to know a bit on the history of Intel processors, as you'll get 
an idea of what is true why and when. I'll only go over the basics here, and use 
up a slot in the extended session to go over the detailed history. We call it 
x86 assembly, and the 32bit processors x86, because the first processor of this 
type was the Intel 8086. Now, the x part is because it was an entire series of 
processors, as it was followed by the (rarely mentioned) 80186 and (more often 
noted) 80286, which is refered to as simple 286 (two eighty-six) or .286 (note 
the dot in front, as if denoting a .50 caliber Browning M2 "Ma Deuce"), and then 
the 386, 486 and so on. The x87 co-processor was following in the steps of the 
x86, adding native floating-point functionality, which would take a lot of time 
to compute with the non-floating-point-capable CPU. Thus floating-point 
operations were delegated to the x87 when needed and the result copied back. By 
the time we moved on from the x86 processors, we got the Pentium processors, 
which are still in production and have, in fact, ahieved a whooping 4.7GHz on 
overclocking without being submerged in liquid nitrogen. These single-core 
processors saw the rise of video games with graphics, though as you know, 
graphics cards are still essential in video gaming. This (the need for a 
graphics card) is directly comparable to the x87's role as a co-processor.</p>
<p>Moving on, the importance of this is that with each CPU, a few more 
instructions were added. Because the x86 systems are not RISC (Reduced 
Instruction Set Computer) but CISC (Complex ISC), there was room for more, and 
most of these commands do what you would do with multiple commands in fewer 
clocks that you could before. The complete list can be found in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings">Wikipedia over 
here</a>, and I suggest you take a brief look at how many are added in each CPU. 
What you should have noticed is that a ton of instructions came with the 
original CPU, quite a few with the 186, a not-so-very few with 286, but an 
impressive amount with the .386. After this we don't see significant additions, 
with perhaps the most important one being the addition of SSE2 instructions 
added with Pentium 4 in 2001, which parallelizes commands (SSE2 meaning Steaming 
SIMD Instructions 2, where SIMD is further expanded to Single Instructin 
Multiple Data, which essentially means "execute this command on a bunch of stuff 
simultaneously"). The main point of this analysis is that the largest parts of 
your code, will be backwards compatible with all the processors all the way back 
to, and including, the .386! Oh, and of course the libraries you use must be 
included in the OS you're using, but it's safe to assume that what we'll use 
should work at least with Windows 98, which is the oldest Microsoft OS being 
used by 0.1% of the population (!!!!). Note that last year Windows 3.11 crashed 
likely for the first time after 25-30 years of running in a French Airport, they 
wrote good code back then. Also note that I was upgrading and maintaining the 
computers of the national healthcare services' ambulance station near the 
university very recently, most computers are running Windows XP. So I suggest 
backwards compatibility at least with Windows XP, as customers that will require 
assembly may well be using old machinery because they honestly don't need 
anything newer as they're probably not playing video games on them or running 
bloatware.</p>
<p>Now you have a thorough idea of what rules govern assembly and are ready to 
proceed to programming.</p>
