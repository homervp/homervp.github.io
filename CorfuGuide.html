<h2>General stuff about the island:</h2>
<h3>General communication:</h3>
<p>Most people speak some rudimentary form of English, since tourism is like 80% of the economy, in public services not so much. If you think people are yelling at you, they're not, we're much like stereotypical Italians, very intense in our interactions. If they're actually shouting you'll know for sure.
</p>

<h2>Mountains:</h2>
<p>It is, just like the rest of Greece, extremely mountainous. Never assume crossing from west to east, will be simple, in fact it takes a couple of hours to go from north to south.
</p>

<h2>Churches:</h2>
<p>You can go in and out and visit at will. Best not to go toward the altar, it is considered a sacred place. IIRC only priests and cleaning personnel are allowed behind it, and even priests always walk around it and not behind it during service.
</p>

<h2>Tourist traps:</h2></h2>
<p>Just fall in, it's fine.
</p>

<h2>Souvenirs (edible):</h2>
<p>Check the super market, you will probably find the same brand at a third the price. This goes for edibles and drinks alike. 
Extra warning about the surrypy traditional sweets (e.g. galaktoboureko): The 
ones in boxes have deceptively small amounts and rather high prices. If you have 
a suitcase that will go in the airplane's lower storage, ask a pastry shop to 
pack some for the airplane. You can also ask them if you can take it aboard (the 
non-surupy stuff you can take for sure).</p>

<h2>Edibles (snacks, to bring back):</h2>
<p>Mádoles are Mandeln, we make them sweeter so I can recommend. Different manufacturers make them different, I will list some in the Town section.
Madoláto is a stretchy sweet thing that comes in long bars and has nuts embedded into it. Not for everyone but worth a try.
Kum Kuat / Kum Quat: orange fruit larger than an olive but smaller than a plum, can be eaten raw, usually is in syrup, can be found as ice cream flavor in pastry shops (see Town section). You can also find liqueur and other byproducts
</p>

<h2>Traditional dishes:</h2>
<p>Corfu-specific:
Sofríto: think slices of beef cooked with a lot of petersil and served with rice or mashed potatoes. Doesn't always look appetizing but it's very nice.
Pastitsáda: chunks of beef cooked with a red sauce and served with spaghetti.
Greek:
Giouvétsi: beef cooked with kritharáki (Greek pasta that looks like overgrown rice)
Dolmá: same as the turkish
Lahanodomádes: rice and minced meat wrapped in cabbage leaves and boiled, might be a bit sour depending on the recipe. Usually lemon is added
Yuvarlákia: soup with balls of minced meat with rice boiled along with a bit of egg and lemon (avgolémono)
Gígantes: the biggest of beans baked in a tomato sauce
Moussaká: no introduction needed here
Stifádo: This might have actually started in Corfu but is well-known in Greece as well. Traditionally rabbit (but can also be other meat) cooked in red sauce alongside small onions (which turn very sweet) and served with rice, mashed potatoes, french fries or other.
Saganáki: name of a small skillet, but usually refers to a piece of cheese that has been fried/baked. Delicious appetizer.
Souvláki: skewered meat, typically pork or chicken.
Gýros: you think it's kebáb but it's not. It's a different mix of spices and a different manufacturing process. Typically pork or chicken. Can be served as a serving outside a pita.
Píta-gýros: the well known one. It should have gyros, tomato, potato, onion and tzatziki by default, tzatziki is heavier (a lot more garlic-y) than the imitation stuff abroad. Specifically in Corfu many places also add a red sauce, which is worth it if you ask me. I personally recommend Ninos in the town for this. Can also be eaten while walking, just get an extra paper napkin just in case.
Píta-souvláki: if you want the skewered thing instead of gýros in your píta. More chewy.
Octopus: grilled, "ksydáto" (with vinegar), or boiled with "makaronáki koftó" (a pasta that is broad short tubes). Delicious.
Kalamarákia (tiganitá/fried): should be crisp and not identical, otherwise it's probably not even hand-made. Not very easy to get it done right, but I love it when done right.
Other fish: it's Greece, so it is to be expected.
</p>

<h2>Other food notes:</h2>
<p>I don't remember what it's called in English but the "tis óras (της ώρας)" section will have stuff that are cooked on the spot, i.e. barbecued stuff. This is considered the safe option if for some reason you desperately need to eat but don't trust the establishment (mainly if you're in the middle of nowhere).
Pita gýros is the highest value for money food you can get, but has become more expensive lately. At 3-3.5 euros it's a favorite of students. Some people are fine with one, some need two. Size also varies between establishments.
Italian dishes prepared by non-Italians: I have heard people spoke more Italian than Greek until around 1910 when education curriculum became standardized, so yeah, they know how to make them. We actually still have many Italian words in our vocabulary.
I would avoid restaurants that have stuff like "Traditional greek cuisine" written in way too big letters as potential tourist traps, but mostly because I find it tacky, the food should be fine. The best indicator is whether locals go there. Whenever shopping, feel free to ask the cashier about places around, they'll probably give you their personal favorites. Also at the hotel they will probably know.
</p>

<h2>Getting around:</h2>
<p>There is an extensive bus network and it will be fairly dense in summer. If staying far from the town it is probably best to rent a car. If someone is driving at the wrong side of the road he's probably British, we had them between 1800-1867-ish but we drive on the right side.
</p>

<h2>Safety:</h2>
<p>It's safe. Maybe not "leave your phone and wallet out on the table with no one else around while you for a swim" safe but you're not gonna get shanked or robbed (except by the restaurants).
</p>

<h1>West Coast:</h1>
<h2>Aggelókastro</h2>
<p>So, south of Ag.Georgios Pagon is Aggelokastro, that castle that's on a peak next to the sea, the road isn't great but it's also not awful (compared to what it used to be at least). There is also a place to grab something to eat/drink just opposite.
<img href a="https://cdn.thecrazytourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ccimage-shutterstock_1175033746.jpg">
</p>

<h2>Paleokastrítsa</h2>
<p>Just to the southeast is Paleokastritsa, there's multiiple beaches and an interesting scenery, I think it's also a good place to get a boat ride to see some caves. I personally didn't find it all that exciting (Paleokastritsa) but everyone's talking about it so I guess it must be.
</p>

<h2>Bella Vista viewpoint</h2>
<p>On the road between Aggelokastro and Paleokastritsa is the Bella Vista viewpoint, there's room for a stop and it is indeed a very nice view. The village of Lakones is just before it, I think it has developed touristically lately, Liapades is also nearby and I think has retained a fairly traditional style, could be nice to walk through a bit.
</p>

<h2>Pélekas and Kaiser's ~~Observatory~~ Throne</h2>
<p>Moving maybe 10 km south, still on the west coast (keepin' it real), is Pélekas, and above it is Kaiser's... Well it's Observatory in Greek but it doesn't mean the telescope thing, it's a place to observe the surroundings. I guess it's Kaiser's throne in English, which means jack shit. Anyway, excellent view, highly recommended. Pélekas should have tons of places to eat, some of which will be nicer than others. The lower part of the village will look more traditional and should still be a nice walk.
</p>

<h2>Glifáda Beach</h2>
<p>West of Pélekas, but you take the road from the north, you have to go around a peak. The northern edge right next to the cliffside is nice (or used to be, we haven't been there in a while for reasons mentioned later), the southern end has fewer people. Nudist beach at the southern tip, barely anyone there.
</p>

<h2>Sinarádes (honorable mention):</h2>
<p>Where I'm from. It's big. The philharmonic has 120 active members and 60-80 are playing during holidays. There is a folklore museum which is basically a house set up with all the traditional stuff, I hear it's not bad. There are a lot of old buildings, there are some old gates that have inscriptions from the 1700s, and the overall tone has stayed traditional. Aerostato was a tourist attraction and still is visitable (tourist busses do come) but the café has closed long ago. We have restaurants that probably won't rob you blind, since they cater just as much to the residents.
</p>

<h2>Kontogialós Beach</h2>
<p>Just to the south of Glifáda. Very nice, but no tips on that one, I've been there a couple of times at most. Fairly well known.
</p>

<h2>Agios Górdios ('Ai Górdis) + beach</h2>
<p>Note: the G is sort of a hard y sound here, kinda close to the French or southern 'r' but not really. Just something to keep in mind when receiving instructions from locals. The beach is sometimes kinda sandy, sometimes all stones, but it has a lot of nightlife, and I can't really put my finger on it but it feels like it's many smaller establishments which makes it a bit more friendly and less in-your-face about the fact that it's touristic. Not really traditional but it's nice. The beach extends to the north waaaay beyond the settlement, if you're looking for something less populated head that way. I would personally recommend it for an evening/night out. There is a restaurant called Steven's higher up on the mountainside, if you phone ahead you can get a table with a great view, great for a nice sunset. There is one on a bit of a platform, highly recommended. My grandfather practically built that place (well he built half of Ai Gordis), if you talk to the owner send my regards.
</p>

<h2>Halikoúnas and 'Issos beaches</h2>
<p>very interesting place because: between the two, there are about 5km of beach, and behind the beach is a semi-salt-water lake, I think just 30m away at many points. Very sandy beach, lots of space. Behind Issos (the southern part), between the beach and the lake, is a bit of a dune system.
</p>

<h2>Further south:</h2>
<p>Gardenos beach I have heard of, I don't think I've been there though. Safe to say the southern half will be sparse in people. If you're into hiking, at the very southern tip there is a trail, and it should have some very nice views.
</p>

<h1>East Coast</h1>
<p>The town is at the center. It gets its own section.
</p>

Southern half:
<h2>Kanóni:</h2>
<p>Heading south from the town you'll find Kanóni, it's by the airport, has a nice view and at some of the cafés/restaurants you can even see the landing airplanes passing lower than you.  Worth a visit. It also has a view to Pontikonisi, which should be accessible by boat.
</p>

<h2>Pontikonisi:</h2>
<p>a.k.a. "Mouse Island", but the name is probably because refugees from Pontus (the Black Sea) settled there in 1922 after some unpleasant business with Turkey. It is iconic and thanks to a song from old Greek comedy (The Countess of Corfu / I Kómissa tis Kérkyras / Η Κόμισσα της Κέρκυρας) Is the second thing that comes to mind when thinking Corfu. The movie is also good, with our native superstar Réna Vlachopoúlou in the lead role (more on that in the Town section).
</p>

<h2>Achílleion:</h2>
<p>Further south and slightly mainland (up in the mountain), the royal residence of Princess Elizabeth of Austria (or with the nickname I never really liked, Princess Sissy). It's a museum. It's nice. Go there.
</p>

<h2>Kaiser's Bridge:</h2>
<p>Just look at it when you pass "under". Nothing much to see and do but you will pass under it.
</p>

<h2>Benítses:</h2>
<p>A quite nice former fishing village, plenty of nice places to eat or have a drink and very traditional. Walk around the sea-side and further inside. There is also a cool trail that leads up to a church (you have to pass through a small tunnel, if you're comfortable with that), I think on Easter and a couple more occasions yearly the whole village walked up that trail to the church. It is best in spring but should also be nice in summer. Not too much of a hike but you can go further up if you're a masochist. There's also some Roman Baths there. Allegedly this is also where Odysseus washed up in the Odyssey.
</p>

<h2>Other beaches:</h2>
<p>Heading further south there are many small beaches which might be to one's liking, there will be a few people but they're not flooded by hotels.
</p>

<h2>Moraitika and Mesongi:</h2>
<p>A settlement with two beaches on either side of the mouth of a river that is fairly well know.
</p>

<h2>Petrítis:</h2>
<p>Very small settlement with a reputation for a nice beach and scenery. Note that most of the beach is further south from the last building.
</p>

<h2>Notos beach:</h2>
<p>Just south of Petritis is Notos beach and there is an establishment called Electra's Garden, which is very nice. It overlooks a tiny gulf adjacent to Notos beach. There is also Panorama tavern a hundred or so meters to the south, which is a nice place to eat.
</p>

<h2>Alikés:</h2>
<p>Literally the word for those places where sea water dries and the salt is harvested. There is a very long beach as you approach it from the west (yes the orientation changed a bit here). If by car, can be worth a pass by, if by bus I would say continue.
</p>

<h2>Lefkími + port:</h2>
<p>Lefkimi itself is kinda big but spread out. There are many places to eat but what is probably really worth it is one of the places by the river on its east side.
A small port is also there where ferries carry passengers and cars to/from Igoumenitsa and boats take tourists to Paxos. The ferry from here to Igoumenitsa is just under an hour, whereas from the Town it is 1.5-2 hours (there is a fast ship that takes about an hour but it's only one).
</p>

<p>Further south there is Kávos beach, I've heard of it a fair bit and it has tourist activity but it's so far from home that I don't remember going there.
</p>

<h1>East Coast - north</h1>
<h2>Too many well-known small beaches</h2>
<p>Leaving the town toward the north you can go to Kontókali bay and beach, Gouviá and Límni, what I can recommendin this area is Ypapanti Church, due to its location (check on map). The water is murky at that point due to a river, so I would say stick with one of the other beaches for swimming, but if you're in the area it could be a nice spot for a panoramic picture. There are more small beaches as you continue north. The coastline here is very wild in shape.
</p>

<h2>Dassiá beach:</h2>
<p>It's nice. Part of it has a forest maybe 15 meters from the sea.
</p>

<h2>Ipsos + beach:</h2>
<p>It's a nice beach, this is where we usually go but mostly because my brother's godfather has a house there, where he stays during summer (otherwise it's a bit far from where we usually are). Some parts of the beach are very stone-y but people have opened mostly-clear paths to the sandy part in the sea, keep that in mind and don't torture yourself trying to step over the rocks in the sea. Als has good food but will rob you blind. Papagálos has good souvlaki/pita-gyro. The chinese restaurant is run by greek staff as far as I can tell, but they look like they love what they're doing, I approve. Sugar is a nice pastry shop too.
</p>

<h2>Barbati:</h2>
<p>Nice scenery, too much stone.
</p>

<p>Taverns, taverns, taverns, small beaches, small beaches, small beaches, treacherous roads...
</p>

<h2>Kerassiá beach:</h2>
<p>Only been there once but I like it aesthetically.
</p>

<p>more small beaches... It is a very mountainous region so there are many small beaches between the cliffs etc, generally all are accessible.
</p>

<h2>Agios Stefanos:</h2>
<p>small harbor for small boats. It's nice for a drink or a bite but I think they went too hard on the tents.
</p>

<h2>Kassiopi:</h2>
<p>Sizeable settlement, multiple beaches, Byzantine-Benetian castle, it's nice, if you've gone so far north I'd say stop there, walk around, grab a bite. At this point we have crossed over to the northern coast and are heading west.
</p>

<h2>Kalamáki beach:</h2>
<p>I think that's where we stopped with Gábor and Dóra. Nice. Very shallow, you're practically in Albania by the time you've reached neck-deep.
</p>

<h2>Gialiskári beach:</h2>
<p>Interesting scenery, more wild and untouched.
</p>

<h2>Sidári:</h2>
<p>Nice place, you can take a boat to Erikoussa, one of the small islands to the north-west. The beach is nice but you should really go to the north-west at the bays, Canal d'Amour, the tunnels and so on and so forth. The coastline there is great.
</p>

<h2>Apotripiti beach:</h2>
<p>Never been there, but I gotta say it looks kinda cool on the map
</p>

<p>wilderness....
</p>

<h2>Cape Drastis and the northwestern tip:</h2>
<p>Quite nice scenery, but Sidari is probably enough.
</p>

<p>Coming over the end and a bit south on the West Coast there is Agios Stefanos, from where you can get a boat to Othoni, Erikousa and Mathraki (in order of fame).
</p>

<h1>Northern mainland:</h1>
<h2 class="auto-style1">East to west:</h2>


<h2>Peritheia:</h2>
<p>This is an abandoned* village, IIRC 130 buildings, most of which very large and wealthy houses. If ruins are your thing, this the place to be. Some of the last Houses to be occupied, that were preserved and not reclaimed by nature, are operating taverns. There also used to be a fox that came there for food, not sure if it's still around. To the south there is another place called Paliés Sinies, similarly mostly ruins. Peritheia is well known as a tourist stop.
</p>

<h2>Moní Ypsiloý Pnatokrátoros</h2>
<p>Monastery. Great view.
</p>

<h2>Nymfes Waterfall:</h2>
<p>Pretty cool waterfall. Nymfes is also nearby, not bad for a pit stop. There are also springs and some other stuff I think.
</p>

<h2>Kyprianides Waterfall and spring:</h2>
<p>not as famous as Nymfes, still nice.
</p>

<h2>Central island
Ioannis Kapodistrias museum:</h2>
<p>Kapodistrias worked for Russia as a diplomat and was the Russian representative at the Congress of Vienna, before coming to Greece to serve as first leader of the nation (at the time Corfu wasn't in Greek hands but he was from Corfu, plus some shithead politician on the mainland straight-up murdered him). I didn't even know the museum was a thing until I stumbled upon it now, but it looks good.
</p>

<h2>Trypas/Tripa tavern:</h2>
<p>It's a menu place, i.e. you pay 40-50 per person and they start bringing some predetermined stuff. Local cuisine, high quality, most people don't make it through the entire menu due to sheer size. You will see on one wall tons of pictures with celebrities etc. Yes, they ate there.
</p>

<h2>Visitable workshops and distilleries:</h2>
<p>For wine, soap, kum quat, mádoles and madoláto, and just about anything.
</p>

<h1>The Town</h1>
<p>Let's use the Old Fortress for orientation, since it's the east-most point and generally hard to miss.
</p>

<h2>The Old Fortress:</h2>
<p>Combination of Venetian and British structures, the battlements etc are Venetian, you can generally access all of the western part and walk all the way to the top, which has a great view. There is a café, sometimes there are concerts. There is also a byzantine museum I think, as well as the university's school of music and one of those places whre government documents are kept.
</p>

<h2>Spianada square:</h2>
<p>Also hard to miss, just outside the Old Fortress. Also sometimes refered to as the Esplanade but just use Spianáda when there. It is one of the biggest squares in Europe. Originally it was a clearing for artillery to mow down attacking armies. There is a big octagonal gazebo-like thing in the south side where concerts often take place. On the north side there is a cricket square where you can sometimes see people playing, There is also a large parking space but don't count on it, best to park a bit to the south.
</p>

<h2>Liston:</h2>
<p>The buildings lining the northern half of the square, built by the French in imitation of the rue de Rivoli. Many nice small cafés etc. Zisimos (now bought out by others, but they always keep the name as a subtitle as he was there for a century or so) is a traditional spot, but Josephine and Liston (the café) are also valid, as is the pizzeria Gondola or the restaurant Aigli (ornounced Égli, again the g is that hard y thing). The road just behind the buildings is also nice.
</p>

<h2>Nikiforou Theotoki str.</h2>
<p>It's the road the leaves the square through the middle of Liston, this is your main travel axis in the old city. As you travel away from the square, on your right hand side is a square labeled on google maps as "pl. ir. kipriakou agona (platia iroon kipriakou agona / square of the heroes of the cypriot struggle)", that labeling is bullshit, everyone calls it "plakáda t'agioú", square of the saint, refering to St. Spyridon, whose cathedral is just behind it. There's a bank note museum there, never been inside. Before your reach it you will also see Bochótis (Μποχώτης), an old pastry shop, it's good and has good ice cream. As you pass that square, on your left is Papagiórgis (Παπαγιώργης), another very good pastry shop. Good spot to get mádoles and madoláto, also good ice cream. Further down, when the road does a small sidestep to the right, you should look left, there is the Mikró Kafé (small café), a pretty nice coffee shop. Keep heading downhill and at the end you can either turn left into the Jewish quarter or right (and optionally again left) and you'll find yourself near the New Fortress. The area to the right of this point is full of neat little places to eat, go into the narrow streets a bit and explore.
</p>

<h2>North of Nikiforou Theotóki:</h2>
<p>Very nice streets to get lost in. The area is relatively small so don't worry too much. Let's say you are moving clockwise, there is a nice square in front of a new marina, to the left is the New Fortress, to the right I suggest you walk along the street, it's basically on the old fortifications by the sea. You will reach a corner from where you can see the Old Fortress. The house athe corner is Kapodistria's family house. If you head down under the walls, that place is known as Faliráki, it is very nice to sit at En Plo, at the edge, but service can sometimes be very slow there. Continuing south, on your right hand side you will see a building with a stairway heading to a first-floor roofed entrance, that's where that iconic Corfu comedy was shot. Moving further you reach the palace, and right behind it is again Liston and Spianada. It is an Asian Museum nowadays, the area inside is nice. Come to the front side and you'll see it has a garden, that front harden often hosts concerts by the philarmonic. Head toward the see and go behind the palace, there is a smaller garden, very pleasant with a nice view. You have successfully circled the northern part of the city. Now let's say you go into the streets. I don't know why they're censored in Google Maps. The Venetian Well is a high-profile restaurant, pricey but not unaffordable. It's iconic but I wouldn't prioritize eating there that much. There's a Byzantine museum, I've never been inside, probably because I never found it. There is also a museum of Dionýsios Solomós, the guy who wrote the national anthem, it's probably his house.  There is also the catholic Metropolitan Church of Virgin Mary, the streets to its north-east have a lot of tourist shops. If you didn't find it from the front, go down that street, down the steps etc, then turn and look back toward the church, it's an interesting layout of buildings, a small square and the church behind. Back on the slightly more southern side, The cathedral of Agios Spyridon is a key point. You can see the belfry from anywhere up high. Some days you can pay respects to the mummified corpse of the saint if you are feeling rather gothic. The street bordering the church to the north is rather touristy, and heading west you end up at another touristy street that will bring you backto Nikiforou Theotoki. On the south is mostly religious shops, and you can get directly to Plakáda t'agioú.
Let's head south now.</p>

<h2>South of Nikiforou Theotoki</h2>
<p>The street directly south is Sevastianou, Ninos tavern is there, it is where I personally get my pita-gyros. There is a pastry shop almost directly opposite, they may or may not rob you but they have good quality. I recommend getting a Pasta Flora from there, it's a nice sweet "pie". The one directly next to that street is Agion Pánton (of all the saints, it's a holiday in Greece), there are some nice shops there, "i Pita tou Pappoú" (Grandpa's pita) is a greek chain of souvlaki restaurants, it's alright. "Tram" is more interesting it has some greate crépes at the time of this writing. The street connecting all these to the west (i.e. running north-south) is Michail Teotoki, you will use it a lot as well. The well at the intersection of M.Theotoki and Ag.Panton is a good point of reference, just mention "the well" (not the venetian one) if you need to get relative directions from someone. Also a good meeting point.
The next horizontal street is more central and is Evgeníou Voulgáreos. On its east side it reaches the edge of Liston at the "Pentofánaro" (5-lamp thing), which you'll notice actually has 5 lamps on one pole in the center. Don't ask why, I don't know. 
Near the well, the huge neoclassical building is the old town hall / San Giacomo theatre. Behind it is a nice square called Platía Dimarchíou (town hall square). The café on the south-west has a nice garden. Kritikós used to be a renowned pastry shop but went all tourist-y and is no longer noteworthy. On the north-east side is a good souvlaki shop, next to the catholic Cathedral. On the south-east end is "Stazi Méli (Στάζει Μέλι)", you can get some good loukoumádes, both traditional (sith honey or sugar and cinammon) and more modern (with chocolate filling, toppings etc). That street is Guildford street, if you take it further south you will find some restaurants, possibly a bit pricey, but they have good reputation. I have seen celebrities there a few times. Going all the way to the end, to your right you will see the boutique hotel Bella Venezia. It's probably nice, never had a reason to go there. It's also a landmark locals can use to give you directions. If you turn left on the other hand and go through any of the streets you will end up back at Spianada, in fact close to the Cavalieri hotel. It has a roof garden restaurant that has a very nice view. You can sit there for drinks and/or food with a nice view at the sunset.
</p>

<h2>Jewish Quarter:</h2>
<p>It's a mess so I'm not even giving directions. Synagogue. Never been inside. Albert Cohen square, not noteworthy but might as well. The house of this Cohen is on the hillside, unfortunately not doing very well. Some really big abandoned buildings are on the west end, the rest is nice for a walk, the restaurants should be good, they've all been there for years.
</p>

<h2>New Fortress:</h2>
<p>There is a square at the main entrance, you can grab a coffee there. Let me remind you that we are a bit past the end of Nikiforou Theotoki, with the marina to the north. This part of the fortress is a naval base so you cannot enter. Allegedly you can enter from the south side the past few years, I keep forgetting to check because it's just ingrained in my brain that it's closed. Anyway, let's head to that south side. turn west (your right), there is the church of Santa Maria di Carmine, behind that is La Tabernita Mexicana, great place for mexican food but keep in mind that the limit between it and the Jasmine café is not very clear. The entrance to the fortress is allegedly just past that. At this point you can also a) go through a tunnel in the fortress to get to the rear side, there is a farmer's market there, and more fortress walls, or b) walk along the hill over the top of the Jewish quarter, along the wall. This is a nice walk. You will end up close to Gerogiou Theotoki (not Nikiforou Theotoki). Let's switch to West here:
</p>

<h2>West (new city):</h2>
<p>Georgiou Theotoki is your main axis here. The north-east end connects with Evgeniou Voulgareos, the last bid has become a pedestrian street (at last). Just before the pedestrian segment is the new theater. No, we don't think it looks that good either, I'm sure the architect is a persona non grata on the island. But you can still watch a good play or concert there. Heading south-west you will see "Georgios Theotokis Square", this is only half-bullshit but we always call it "Saroko" locally (probably from San Rocco or something to that effect). This is a solid point of reference and crossroads. Don't be afraid if the street lamps aren't working, it's normal. Not sure why, but it's not a problem, just follow the standard priority rules. To the south this branches off to Leof(oros) Alexandras (Alexandras Avenue), this will get you back to the coastal bit south of the Old Fortress, though rather far. From the north side and to the west, along Plichroniou Konstanta is the police. Yes, you can report me for writing an awful guide there, no, they will not arrest me. To the southwest, from either end, you will end up at the British Cemetery, it's a pleasant walk. Behind it are the maximum security prisons, the police can take you there. If you take the parallel road to the left (that does not lead to a hilltop) you will find the airport eventually. This area generally has the lest tourist-oriented shops, so clothing, electronics etc are easier to find here. Heading off to the north-east instead, you end up at Madouki, and the new harbor above it. That's where the cruise ships and ferries moor. There is a fairly big park and the ruins of many large industrial buildings, but not much else otherwise.

<h2>South part:</h2>
<p>The main point of interest is walking along the seaside. The road is Leoforos Dimokratias but we just call the general area Garítsa (again the g thing). Toward the sea you will see an interesting bar over the nautical club, the nautical club itself and a small spot of green where you can sit and watch the sea. At sea level on the land side is the Corfu Palace hotel, supposedly one of the better places to be staying. You can also go there just for breakfast or coffee. There's also a casino. After that and to the right is the Arhcaeological Museum, which I believe is now open. There are mooring spots for small boats along the coastline, and you can swim there too if you want. On your right (land side) you will pass Douglas' Obelisk, where Alexandras Avenue ends, and a long strip of greenery will start, it's nice to walk through but walking by the sea is also  nice if it isn't 45 degrees. Also if you walk inland a bit you will find the ancient monument to Manekratis, and a small museum that I have never seen open. When the road starts bending again, restaurants and cafés will slowly start showing up in the greenery. These are generally good. The houses you see behind are mostly old fishermen's houses and are pretty authentic, the larger mansions are also authentic. Keep walking toward the end of the peninsula, at the tip is the Windmill, another landmark and point of reference for meeting and orientation (Anemómilos in Greek, Ανεμόμυλος). The Nautilus café is very nice to sit at, especially with a seaside table. At Anemomilos the local winter swimming club go for a dive every day. There are more cafés and hotels where you can have a coffee moving on south, along the tip. Continuing you will find a small beach, the road goes a bit inland and continues uphill, parallel to the sea. We are at the edge of the town now. You will reach an intersection, to your right are some ancient ruins (left hand side as you head north), but there are many more if you continue straight ahead (and a medieval church, yes.). a few dozen meters later, opposite the medieval ruined church, is the entrance to Mon Repos, occasional residence of British governors and later of Elizabeth of Austria, until she built the Achilleion. Prince Philip (late Husband of our noble empress, Queen Elizabeth II) was born there. I hear it is undergoing renovations, but the general estate is nice to walk in, it also has an open-air theater, an ancient church and a small beach you can go to for swimming.
