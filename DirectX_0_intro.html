<p>DirectX Tutorial 0: Intro</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re here to learn DirectX,  you already know what it is. Developed by Microsoft and currently at version  12, DirectX is probably the leading real time rendering technology. It&rsquo;s direct  opponent is OpenGL, which is non-proprietary but that also means there is no  central reference for it.<br />
  DirectX is  free, and it is mainly used with C++. Though theoretically you can use it with  any C++ distribution, it is normally used with Microsoft&rsquo;s Visual C++. This  tutorial will not get into the details of how you set these up. The SDK for  each has a straightforward setup process.<br />
  The  tutorials are written on material developed in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.  The DirectX version used will be DirectX 9, since it has the largest backwards  compatibility. However developing in DirectX 11 should be trivial once one is  acquainted with 9. Furthermore, a version newer than 9 is not required as we  have a lot of ground to cover before we can exploit the features of the later  versions.<br />
  <strong>            Note: </strong>there is a chance that the  installation of the DirectX SDK will mess up the Visual Studio installation.  This is a problem acknowledged by Microsoft, and can be solved by performing a  repair operation on Visual Studio, through it&rsquo;s installer. Though time consuming,  it should not put your software in peril, and definitely does not hinder your  projects.</p>
<p>            DirectX  typically builds upon the Win32Api. You can skip the Win32Api tutorials, but it  is advised that you read through at least the Win32 main window tutorial, as well  as the input/message handling tutorial.<br />
  The  following tutorials will cover initialization of DirectX, 2D rendering, 3D  rendering, light effects, and loading models from files, as well as some useful  techniques for game development. Note that some tutorials may not have been  added yet, content is uploaded when ready.</p>
<p><strong>            Why DirectX?</strong><br />
  <strong>            </strong>DirectX, though it is a  low-level approach to graphics, is essentially the basis of all graphics  applications in Windows, and lies under most if not all major game engines.  When looking for jobs or internships, you will see that certain companies ask  for people with real time rendering experience, and that generally refers to  DirectX and OpenGL developers. DirectX also lies behind some major CAD  applications, such as Autodesk&rsquo;s 3DS Max and Maya, though these applications  also use OpenGL as they target multiple systems.</p>
