&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating a BoundingSphere that 
encapsulates the entire model</strong></p>
<p>BoundingSpheres are really useful, they allow you to check collision with 
only one addition (their position) and one distance calculation (which is three 
squares and additions, and one square root). The problem is, you get one 
BoundingSphere for each mesh, what do you do if you have a multi-mesh model? 
You've gotta calculate your own BoundingSphere. Thankfully, it's not that hard, 
let's have a look:</p>
<p>First, let's figure out the math of how and why. If a mesh is inside the 
sphere of the main mesh (which is safe to assume it's mesh[0], as you'll 
probably make the hull of a ship before the superstructure, engines, bridge or 
whatever), then you don't need to do anything. If it's outside... well, you 
could try and calculate a sphere that contains both spheres, but that would take 
some more complex operations, you would have to find the two farthest points of 
the spheres and create a sphere centered midway between them with a radius half 
their distance, but we can spare the time for now, as well as a calculation or 
two. You can try this however yourself.</p>
<p>So when a sphere is outside the original sphere, we'll expand the original 
sphere to include it. One step at a time though:</p>
<p>Step one, determine if the original sphere includes the secondary sphere. To 
be within the original sphere, the distance between the centers has to be less 
than the radius of the original, and it has to be less by at least the radius 
of the secondary. You can just pass the radius of the second sphere to the 
right-hand side of the equation. So the evaluation reads as follows:</p>
<p>Vector3.Distance(mm.BoundingSphere.Center, sphereCenter) &gt; sphereRadius - 
mm.BoundingSphere.Radius</p>
<p>Now, throw that into an if() statement, and you know if the original is 
sufficient. Next, you need to expand the original sphere. One, perhaps naive 
thought, is to just add the radius of the second sphere, the problem with this 
is that, in rare occasions, the second mesh may be far enough from the original 
mesh that it lays entirely outside the original mesh's sphere. The solution is 
for the original sphere to increase by the distance to the farthest point of the 
second sphere from the first one's center. The center remains the same, but the 
radius now becomes the distance between the two spheres plus the radius of the 
second sphere:</p>
<p>Vector3.Distance(mm.BoundingSphere.Center, sphereCenter) + 
mm.BoundingSphere.Radius</p>
<p>Now let's fill in the gaps, essentially we just have to store the data into a 
new BoundingSphere structure:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="auto-style1">this</span>.sphereCenter = 
model.Meshes[0].BoundingSphere.Center;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="auto-style1">this</span>.sphereRadius = 
model.Meshes[0].BoundingSphere.Radius;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="auto-style1">foreach</span> (<span class="auto-style2">ModelMesh</span> 
mm in model.Meshes)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (<span class="auto-style2">Vector3</span>.Distance(mm.<span class="auto-style2">BoundingSphere</span>.Center, 
sphereCenter) &gt; sphereRadius - mm.<span class="auto-style2">BoundingSphere</span>.Radius)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span class="auto-style1">this</span>.sphereRadius = <span class="auto-style2">
Vector3</span>.Distance(mm.<span class="auto-style2">BoundingSphere</span>.Center, 
sphereCenter) + mm.<span class="auto-style2">BoundingSphere</span>.Radius;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="auto-style1">this</span>.boundingSphere = new
<span class="auto-style2">BoundingSphere</span>(sphereCenter, sphereRadius);</p>
<p>Where mm is the ModelMesh inside the model. This concludes the tutorial,
