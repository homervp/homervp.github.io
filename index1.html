	      <h2>About me:</h2>
	      <br />
          <h3> Currently a first year student, other than studying attentively the running lessons I am becoming familiar with web development and am working on game programming with Microsoft XNA framework and Unity3D in my free time. C++ is my language of choice, though I am flexible when it comes to working with other languages. I especially like working with lower level languages and finding out what is really going on under the hood, and am looking forward to learning assembly for ARM and later applying it on platforms like the Arduino Uno and Robostix. In other fields, I spend my spare time reading literature, sketching, assembling scale models and playing some guitar or electronic organ. I have C2 certificates in English and French and am about to start studying Italian and German.</h3>

          <h3>Bird of prey, a top-down, 2D vertical scrolling shoot'em up around WWII air raids, developed with Microsoft XNA framework. The game introduced me to C# and the XNA, leading to fast and effective development. Some of the mechanics include day/night selection, upgrading, saving/loading game (possibly not to be implemented in the demo) and multiple terrains. A demo will be ready soon, first the url will be sent to individuals and later will be placed here. The game will soon be rebuilt with better programming so as to fix a number of bugs that occured as the code became progressively more complex. The Facebook page is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BirdOfPreyIndieGame">here</a>, and the Steam Greenlight Concept submission is <a title="Bird_Of_Prey_Steam" href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=204133220" alt="Bird Of Prey PC">here</a>.</h3>
          <h3>Unity3D: 2 different projects are being loosely run for experimentation, each allowing me to learn a particular aspect of Unity, soon one will be temporarily dropped in favor of the other, while eventually one will be chosen for completion and hopefully release in the future. Great emphasis is given in realistic physics and stable behavior.</h3>
<h3>XNA: Another project has been started in XNA under the name Survival Wasteland, utilizing more complex game mechanics and with code far easier to modify. Some of the mechanics include an inventory system, crafting, interacting with environment and man-made objects, use of multiple gameplay areas and more to come. The project intends to create a game where everything the player does can theorhetically be done in a near identical way in real life. The project's facebook page is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SurvivalWastelandTheGame">here</a>.<br />
  <br />
I am also studying the Java graphics libraries and intend to start another project in collaboration with a fellow stydent shortly.</h3>
<h3>            Additionally I am familiarizing with web   development, in particular HTML, CSS and Javascript, partial results of these studies can be seen on this page.</h3>

        <h3>Tutorials: To gain a better understanding of subjects and knowledge I use, I am writing tutorials for other programmers to use, as much of their content is hard to find, and is often inexistent in the form of a tutorial. Currently I have uploaded tutorials on C and the Win32Api, while I add to these I will write tutorials for C++, the GDI, and later for the XNA framework. These can be found in the <a href="TutorialCentral.html">Tutorial Section</a>.</h3></div>
