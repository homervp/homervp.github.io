<p><strong>Pointers:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>C# is a relatively higher level language, even closer to Java than C++ in my opinion, and one consequence of this is the fact that pointers are discouraged as unsafe types. However one can still use pointers just as in C/C++ by declaring them unsafe and by adding the /unsafe parameter to the compilation process. According to Microsoft's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9s7c9wdw.aspx">page</a> about compiler options, you have to do that manually through the Visual Studio command prompt, which you will find under the Tools tab. The webpage provides a link to the appropriate page for the command prompt syntax.</p>
<p>Another solution given in the page about the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ct597kb0.aspx">unsafe compiler option</a> is to go to the project's properties page (in the right hand panel, the Solution Explorer, right click on the second item in hierarchy), go to the Build tab and check &quot;Allow unsafe code&quot;.</p>
<p>Though MSDN failled to load versions other than 2013, it is the same process for VS2010 Ultimate.</p>
<p>MSDN's page on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t2yzs44b.aspx">unsafe code and pointers</a> states some of the benefits of unsafe code, though the main idea is that they are related to having higher performance by reducing checking array limits and similar processes.</p>
