  <h2>Work, tutorials and resources hosted here</h2>
  <p> Send me an e-mail at
  Homer V P _@t gmail d0t com
  this is the e-mail I check every day, multiple times per day (except when travelling etc) so I will more than likely respond within 24 hours, possibly even within an hour.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Tech support for my video games or software</h2>
  <p> In the website where they are hosted, there should be a "contact the developer" link somewhere (on IndieDB for example it's to the right, under the project stats). If a week has passed and I haven't replied, you may send to my e-mail, but please use the appropriate platform when possible.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Other</h2>
  <p>There's something other than those?! Alright, use the e-mail. Remember to use a meaningful title, I try to check everything that comes in but if it sounds like a newsletter it might get thrown out.
