<h1>C Tutorial: Lesson 1: Intro</h1>
<p>            Programming  should not be regarded as hard or easy. It is very easy to start programming  (at least in C, which we will study), and it is fairly easy to continue, as  long as you have the right teacher. The problem is that teachers are different,  and often they speak to an audience other than the one you are in.</p>
<p>
  This is why  I chose to write these tutorials. The tutorials on C are aimed at those who  want a relatively fast course into programming, oriented mostly toward game  programming as they will cover what you need to continue with the GDI, XNA and  any other tutorials I might make in the future. I advise you to focus more on  the C++ tutorials for practice as C++ replaces some C functions with far more  practical ones.  <br /></p>
<p>
  But before  we start you will need a compiler. C works on pretty much any computer as most  popular operating systems are built on C and C++, however you will have to heed  the OS version of compilers (that means that DevC++ for Windows will nor run on  Unix, and vice versa). I will suggest you use Dev-C++ by Bloodshed, it is one  of the most popular free compilers around, though many prefer others. GCC is  also a well known compiler which might come with your Ubuntu OS, but it is a  command line compiler which I find impractical and highly annoying. In any  case, find whichever one is more suitable for you, go to it&rsquo;s page, find the  download tab, select the right version and download it. While installing look  out for a few things:<br />
  -Advertisement  oriented checkboxes for setting your default browser, start page or setting up  any toolbars. You absolutely do now want anything messing around with your  computer in that way.<br />
  -Options  for specific file types. Chances are the installation will ask you if you want  it to associate specific file types with the compiler, make sure you have .c  and .cpp files checked.<br />
  -Installation  directory. Chances are your projects will be somewhere in the installation  folder. Visual Studio places them in it&rsquo;s own folder in MyDocuments, but each  compiler has it&rsquo;s own way of working. With GCC and other such compilers you do  not have to worry about that as you will have it create the executables where  your manually created source files are, or in the case of DevC++ and other  compilers with an IDE (Integrated Development Environment, which generally  means a graphical user interface (UI)) you will do everything from within the  program.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
  Now on how  to compile and work with various compilers, so I do not have to waste any more  text on compiler specific details in the future. For GCC you will open a  command prompt window in the directory with your source file and type: gcc  &lt;mysourcecode.c&gt; -o &lt;programName&gt;. This tells it, in this order, to  start GCC compiler, use a file named mysourcecode.c, specify the output (-o) to  be called &lt;programName&gt;. DevC++ and Visual Studio have multiple working  areas, the largest one is where you write your code, the lower one is where any  errors during compilation are displayed, and other ones can be set up so you  can see other files in the project or for any other functionality that is  provided. There should be a &ldquo;build&rdquo; tab somewhere on top, after File, Tools,  Edit and so on, there you will find a compile command, or possibly compile and  run. In Visual Studio you can hit F5 and then select Yes when prompted to build  the solution, or first build it and then execute directly, Ctrl+Shift+B  followed by F5.</p>
<p><br />
  I assume  you can find the File -&gt; new project option, so make one, name it whatever  you want, select it to be a C or C++ project, console application if anyone  asks, and start coding! For GCC you will have to make a .txt file and rename it  to .c when it&rsquo;s ready for compilation, or directly a .c file and open it with a  text editor (such as Notepad, Notepad++, Pico, Nano, Gedit and so on).</p>
